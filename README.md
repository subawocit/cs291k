## Model weights and codes
- clip backbone model weights: https://github.com/wangzhecheng/SkyScript
- clip backbone model code: https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip
- vitdet (MAE) backbone model weights: https://github.com/sustainlab-group/SatMAE

## Datasets:
- landslides
- landslide4sense: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tekbahadurkshetri/landslide4sense
- dataset used in paper "A novel Dynahead-Yolo neural network for the detection of landslides with variable proportions using remote sensing images": https://github.com/Abbott-max/dataset/tree/main
- - note: they didn't provide enough training details (e.g., metric, input image size, batch size, baseline model settings) so I couldn't replicate their results. I'm assuming the mAP in their paper is 0.5 mAP.
 
## Swin-MAE:
- code adapted from https://github.com/Zian-Xu/Swin-MAE
